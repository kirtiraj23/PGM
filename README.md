### PGM
##### Probabilistic Graphical 

##### Basics of Probability
Probability is a measure of the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. Measures of probability range from 0 to 1; zero means an impossible event and one means a certain event.

#### Terminology
##### Trial or experiment: 
An action whose result is uncertain. For example, throwing a dice, tossing a coin, etc.

##### Event: 
A single result of an experiment

##### Sample space: 
The total number of possible outcomes of an experiment

##### Sample point: 
One of the possible outcomes

##### Formula
The probability of an event = Number of favourable outcomes/Total number of possible outcomes

A few common experiments and important points to remember —

##### Tossing a coin

This can lead to two possible outcomes:

1.Heads

2. Tails

The probability of getting either heads or tails is equal and is 0.5

##### Throwing a dice

This can lead to six outcomes; you can get any value between one and six, both included:

The probability of the occurrence of any number is 1/6

##### Picking a card from a deck of cards

This can lead to 52 outcomes. In a deck, there are —

13 cards of hearts

13 cards of spades

13 cards of clubs

13 cards of diamonds
